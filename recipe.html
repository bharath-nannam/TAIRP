                <h2>About Biryani</h2>
                <p>Chicken Biryani is a delicious savory rice dish that is loaded with spicy marinated chicken, caramelized onions, and flavorful saffron rice. For my Biryani, I simplify the order of operations, while retaining the traditional layered approach to assembling it.</p>

                <h2>Best Chicken Biryani</h2>
                <p>Chicken Biryani is a savory chicken and rice dish that includes layers of chicken, rice, and aromatics that are steamed together. The bottom layer of rice absorbs all the chicken juices as it cooks, giving it a tender texture and rich flavor, while the top layer of rice turns out white and fluffy. Buried in the Biryani, you'll find whole cuts of succulent chicken bursting with flavor from the potent array of spices, herbs, and aromatics it's marinated in.</p>
                <p>Whether you're talking Arroz con Pollo, Hainanese Chicken Rice, or Oyako Donburi, chicken and rice is a classic pairing that has permeated culinary culture around the world. It makes sense that earlier in human history, this staple grain would be combined with a domesticated source of protein. Still, the fact that this combination has endured as a popular favorite today, speaks to its unassailable deliciousness. It even inspired me to create this Chicken Coconut Rice recipe.</p>
                <p>For my Chicken Biryani recipe, I've simplified the preparation a bit by marinating the chicken in a spicy mixture of garam masala, garlic, ginger, chili peppers, coriander leaves, and garlic. When fried, the spices and aromatics on the exterior of the chicken caramelize into an insanely flavorful crust. I like to make the fried onions separately, as it allows you to fully caramelize them into a sweet umami-packed layer that contrasts the spicy, savory chicken. For the rice, a quick par-boil with whole spices like cardamom, bay leaves, and cumin infuses some flavor, while ensuring the rice is tender enough steam after the Biryani is assembled.</p>

                <h2>INGREDIENTS FOR CHICKEN BIRYANI</h2>
                <li><b>Chicken</b> - For the most flavor, I recommend using a bone-in skin-on piece of chicken such as thighs or drumsticks. Breast meat will work in a pinch, but it won't be as flavorful, and it will get dry due to the longer cooking time of this dish.</li>
                <li><b>Aromatics</b> - The chicken is marinated with ginger garlic paste along with herbs and spices. As the chicken steams, it releases all these flavors into the rice.</li>
                <li><b>Herbs</b> - I like to use fresh herbs like cilantro (a.k.a. coriander leaves), and fresh mint leaves in my marinade for the chicken. These also make for a nice garnish to sprinkle on top of the Chicken Biryani, so be sure to chop up a little extra. </li>
                <li><b>Spices</b> - I use ground spices like garam masala and ground cinnamon for the chicken marinade. If you can find it, Biryani masala works well too. For the rice, I include whole spices such as green cardamom, cumin, and bay leaves. I also sometimes like to add some cloves or star anise here. The yellow color in the rice comes from saffron, but if you can't find it, turmeric makes a suitable substitute.</li>
                <li><b>Onions</b> - Along with the chicken and rice, the third component of Biryani is fried onions, and I like to have a lot of them. </li>
                <li><b>Ghee</b> - Ghee is butter with the milk proteins and water removed, making it clear. This is why it's also called "clarified butter." It gives you the flavor of butter without worrying about the milk solids burning.</li>
                <li><b>Chili Peppers</b> - I usually use fresh green chilies in my marinade for the chicken to add some heat to this dish, but red chili powder will work as well.</li>
                <li><b>Rice</b> - Biryani should always be made with long-grain rice. I recommend using basmati.</li>
            </ul>
